Hello all at Complex Media,

This web page is my the completed submission of the coding challenge that you asked me to write. I completed most of it. I only had a problem in a few areas:

	1. I couldn't animate the wind blowing the palms trees because there were no separate layers in the psd for the palm leaves.

	2. I had trouble getting the css 3 animation working in i.e. There doesn't seem to be any way to rotate an element with jquery animation (which is i.e. compliant). I'm not sure how to get around this limitation. 

I will continue to work on this and try to fix it. Hopefully if I have an opportunity to come in for an interview I will be be able to show you a version that fully works in i.e.

Thank you for considering me for the position.

Peter Mingione
